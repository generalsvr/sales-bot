M: Good afternoon! My name is [Manager's Name], and I present to you our innovative product - an infocourse on cryptocurrency algotrading and arbitrage. This course will help you learn how to make money on high-yield arbitrage bundles and profit up to 3-6 percent per day. Are you interested?
K: This sounds interesting, but it seems to me that this kind of income may not be available to ordinary people. And how much capital do you need to get started?
M: I understand your doubts, but our infocourse is designed so that anyone can learn algorithmic trading and arbitrage techniques, even with a small initial capital. In fact, with as little as $2,000 you can start making money.
K: That sounds promising. But what are arbitrage bundles and how can they generate income?
M: Arbitrage bundles are a strategy that allows you to profit from price differences in cryptocurrencies on different exchanges. The idea is to buy a cryptocurrency on one exchange at a lower price and sell it on another exchange at a higher price. The difference between the purchase and sale price becomes your profit."""
